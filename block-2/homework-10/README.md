# Introduction

I think there are several ways to acchieve this project. I choose the most simple, taking account of my current skills and experience. I really enjoy to research how hash table and hash functions works, also searching for collisions and performance.

## Setting things up

You just need to run the project, choose which environment do you want:

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
